-- General presentation
  . Code is Qt/C++ using XML, SQLite, MVC, unit-testing
  . Left bar to ease navigation between available modes

-- Managing paths
  . Currently needs access to the code source path (extracted from git), but will be release with a full set of free data.
  . Define output path & user language
    . Database output path
    . Datapack server output path
    . Temp path (not cleaned to avoid massive usage of network/CPU)

-- ATC
  . Full classification, regularly updated
  . You can edit labels and validity of codes
  . Add and remove ATC codes
  . Usually users do not need to edit this classification as it will be fully shared.

-- Interactors
  . Interactors can be a simple ATC code or drug component, but also be a groupment of these.
  . Only interactors and ATC codes are used to compute interaction
  . Warn duplicates

-- DDI
  . DDI are defined using two interactors. You can not define DDI directly using ATC codes or drug component name.
  . You can set the level of risk and text of the alert and text for the management of the interaction.
  . The FreeMedForms community wants to include for each DDI links to scientific publications currently exclusively using pubmed.org referenced papers.
