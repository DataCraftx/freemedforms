   \section getting Getting latest version
    Check the website. \n
    While you are running applications of FreeMedForms suite, please verify the menubar. You will be automatically warned
    if a new version is available over the web.

   \section building Building, and installing
    The code in the SVN will, normally, always build under Linux, FreeBSD, MacOs and Win32. \n
    - Requirements :
        - Qt, at least, version 4.5.0 (better to use Qt4.5.1)
        - You have to manage your configuration of Qt4.5.1
    - There are two ways to build FreeMedForms and derivatives : the release mode and the debug mode. \n
      The release mode will neutralize functions that are not fully functionnal. \n
      The debug mode is the lastest version of the application you buils, it may contains bug and must not be used in current practice.
        - When builind in release mode, please do the `make install` command. Then you will find the binary in the `package` dir.
      \code
       qmake -r -config release freemedforms.pro --spec yourSpecFile
       or
       qmake -r -config release drugsinteractions.pro
       make && make install
       cd packages/YourOSType/NameOfAppBuild/
      \endcode
        - When builind in debug mode, please do not do the `make install` command. You will find the binary in the `bin` dir.
      \code
       qmake -r -config debug freemedforms.pro
       or
       qmake -r -config debug drugsinteractions.pro
       make
      \endcode

   \section testing Testing and bug submition
    <b>Please, before sending us a bug verify that you are using the LATEST version.</b> \n
    You have three possibilities for bug submition :
    - Web site : Issues
    - Debug dialog inside the application, information sending is available only if the application detects an error
    - The mailing list
