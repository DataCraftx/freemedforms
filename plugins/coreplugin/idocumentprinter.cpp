  The printerplugin will create one instance of it and leave it in the pluginmanager pool.
  Get it, and use it for your printing. But remember to never delete it.
  If in user settings, PDF cached is enabled, you can retrieve all printed docs in the QList<Doc>.

  \todo create a queue that manages printing jobs
